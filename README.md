# Pansori

Pansori is a program for creating a Korean language corpus using YouTube videos with Korean subtitles.

This program currently consists of three modules:

- Ingest
- Slice
- Validate

This program automatically creates audio segments with aligned text labels by utilizing the timing information stored in the subtitle data to build the corpus faster.
