# Pansori

Pansori is a program for creating an ASR corpus from YouTube videos with audio and subtitle data. It can be used for any language when the specifier is set in the code.

This program currently consists of three modules:

- Ingest
- Slice
- Validate

This program automatically creates audio segments with aligned text labels by utilizing the timing information stored in the subtitle data to build the corpus faster.

The program is currently being used for a project to create a Korean language corpus and can be used for other languages.
